# Rock Paper Scissors

This program or a mini-game is designed when you donâ€™t have anyone to play or you are under lockdown alone. There are a number of functions that this program requires so let us have an overview of each.

1.a random function: to generate rock, paper, or scissors. 

2.valid function: to check the validity of the move.

3.result function: to declare the winner of the round.

4.scorekeeper: to keep track of the score.

The program requires the user to make the first move before it makes one the move. Once the move is validated the input is evaluated, the input entered could be a string or an alphabet. After evaluating the input string a winner is decided by the result function and the score of the round is updated by the scorekeeper function. 

# Tic Tak Toe

This game is very popular amongst all of us and even fun to build as a Python project. I am pretty sure most of us know how to play it but let me give a quick brush up. 

It is a two-player game and consists of a nine-square grid. Each player chooses their move and with O or X and marks their square one at each chance. The player who succeeds in making their marks all in one line whether diagonally, horizontally, or vertically wins. The challenge for the other player is to block the game for their opponent and also to make their chain. 

For building this project in Python who can use the Pygame Python library that is loaded with all computer graphics and sounds.
